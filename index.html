        <h2> About Me </h2>
        My name is Sean Nelson and it is with great excitement that I introduce myself to you all before the Bootcamp Prep course begins.

        For a little background on me, I am a graduate of the Convergence International Journalism program at the University of Missouri. This is where I first studied in technology. Afterward, I went on to launch the video and social media project for PolitiFact and The Tampa Bay Times. I wanted out of that industry and am now so excited to advance my laymanâ€™s knowledge of software development.

        Outside of work, my passions are bluegrass music and snowboarding. I love the space at Alchemy and look forward to diving in with you all!
